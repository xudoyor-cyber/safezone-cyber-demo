## 💡 What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a cyberattack that lets hackers send malicious commands to your database by inserting harmful input into web forms.

Example:
```sql
' OR '1'='1
This can trick your database to let anyone log in — even without a valid password.

🔐 Why this matters to me
My family once lost $15,000 in a cybercrime attack.
We couldn't recover it, and my parents had to take huge debts.
I decided to become a cybersecurity expert to protect others from this kind of pain.
I want to improve digital security in my country and on the world level.

🧪 How to Run the Project
1. Install Flask (if not installed):
bash

pip install flask
2. Run the safe login demo:
bash

python secure_login.py
Then open your browser and go to:
📍 http://127.0.0.1:5000

Username: admin
Password: 1234

✨ Future Plans
Add vulnerable login demo (to show how attacks work)

Add protection examples in PHP and JavaScript

Make video demo with real-world examples

Turn this into an online mini-course
